ASU FINTECH Bootcamp Student 
## Overview and Origin
For the first module challenge in the Bootcamp, I've been assigned the following homework: 1) Choose a [FINTECH domain](https://www.google.com/search?q=fintech+definition&oq=FINTECH+definition&aqs=chrome.0.0i512l9j0i390.30719j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) that I find relevant or interesting, 2) Choose a company within that domain, 3) Conduct my own research using a case study template as a guide. 4) Write the case study and 5) Upload the case study to my GitHub repository.
After compiling research from myriad sources, like *Tech/BigTech/FINTECH websites* and *Peer-Reviewed Scholary Articles* - I chose the Robo-Advisory (RA) Domain, and Betterment as my company. This case study contains only a portion of data that exists in the RA industry today. As such, it's more limited in scope, especially with this being my first attempt at coding an entire research paper into a Git Repository coding an entire research paper.  It is my sincere desire that you find it to be of value. 
**DISCLAIMER**: the views, beliefs, insights shared in this case study represent my own personal opinions and perspectives. They are NOT official investment recommendations and should not be misconstrued as financial advice. If are interested in sharing feedback, you can reach out to me via email [cryptopeebo@gmail.com](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?fs=1&tf=cm&source=mailto&to=cryptopeebo@gmail.com) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryce-pribyl-ms-cfp®-ctfa-mpas®-22397b225). And with all that said, let's begin! 
## Case Study Template questions 
* **What is the name of the company and when was it incorporated?** <br>
[Betterment Holdings Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betterment) was founded in 2008 in New York City as a FINRA Member firm registered by the SEC, RIA & Broker-Dealer <br>
* **Who are the founders of the company?  How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?** <br>
**Jon Stein**: Founder and Chairman of the Board <br>*Jon's* first exposure to the finance industry started at Manhattan Consulting Group in New York. During this time, he was concerned that traditional finance system was *under*-emphasizing [socioeconomic impact]((https://www.nycfounderguide.com/insight/jon-stein-built-betterment-high-minded-mission-outsider-scrappiness))  and *over*-emphasizing. "making rich people richer and not a lot of actual service provision for everyone else". With [Consumer Confidence](https://money.cnn.com/2008/10/28/news/economy/consumer_confidence/) indicators reaching all-time lows and Big Bank trust seriously waning, Jon chose to explore other financial avenues. He came to the realization in 2017 the wanted to build more confidence before launching a startup. He launched Betterment a year later at the chose first to purse an MBA from an Ivy Leage wouldobtain an MBA from an Ivy-League University sfirst to pursue an Ivy-League MBA in 2007. He still ended up launching Betterment in the middle of graduate school and the Global Financial Crisis [GFC](https://www.rba.gov.au/education/resources/explainers/the-global-financial-crisis.html). <br> 
**Eli Broverman**: Co-founder <br> *Eli*  In  he felt he should prioritize his career over managing his own investments; because he didn't have enough time and felt that an advisor would do better anyway. [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/betterment/company_financials) 'smart' technology solution could automate the investment management process for others who were also feeling the same way he did. In recent years, Eli has partnered with the founders of Acorns to launch a FINTECH Venture Capital firm called [Treasury](https://www.thetreasury.com/), which is also the [Lead Investor](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/betterment/company_financials) for latest series F funding round.<br><br>
* **How is the company funded?  How much funding have they received?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?** <br>
Betterment has been funded through Venture Capital. To date, there have been **10** [funding rounds](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/betterment/company_financials) and over **$435 Million** in Capital Raised. As of December, 2022: **$32 Billion** in Assets Under Management (AUM) and more than **775,000 accounts**<br>
## Business Activities <br> 
* **What specific financial problem is the company (or project) trying to solve?  Who is the company's intended customer?** <br>
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betterment_(company)) describes Betterment as "a company that provides digital investment, retirement and cash management services". In other words, their modus operandi is to continue growing market share in the digital advice arena. They do this by developing innovative financial products and services via three vertical market channels: 1) [**Individual Investors**] (*Retail*), 2) **Employer 401(k) Plan Providers** (*Institutional customers*) and 3) **Independent Financial Advisors** (*Wholesale*) which was built off the [White Label platform](https://www.wealthmanagement.com/blog/betterment-rebranding-its-white-label-service). Betterment's technology platform is in such high demand that advisors are actually paying a premium to be able to use it! Listed below are the home pages of each channel, the brand messaging, as well as the products and services available currently offered. It's pretty obvious, Betterment is trying to solve much more than just one single problem!
[**Individuals**](https://www.betterment.com/work): <br> *"Making people's lives better. We're here to help people turn everyday investments, no mattter how small, into their dreams, no matter how big."* <br>\*Automated Investing Management <br>\*Dollar Cost Averaging <br>\*Tax Loss Harvesting <br>\*Crypto Investing <br>\*IRA and 401ks<br>\*Socially Responsible Investing <br>\*All-in-one Dashboard <br>\*FDIC insured High-Yield Cash Acct w/4% APY, allegedly 12X the National Average <br>\*Hassle-free/no-fee checking <br>\*Betterment Visa Debit Card & Rewards Program <br>\*Expert Guidance <brk>\*Goals-Based Retirement Planning <br><br>

* **What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? What is the unfair advantage they utilize?** <br> 
[Betterment](https://www.betterment.com/crypto) is the only RA firm in the industry today that has direct access to the crypto spot market, fully automated crypto portfolio management
services and **broadly diversifed crypto funds**. They have the most robust RA crypto platform in the industry. Betterment doesn't have just *one* ot *two* managed crypto investment fund, they have *four* spanning across the entire Crypto/Web3/Blockchain/NFT/DeFi ecosystem.

Some of their closest competitors have gained traction lately. For example, [Sofi's crypto platform](https://www.sofi.com/invest/buy-cryptocurrency/) has exciting technology and direct access to a wide selection of coins and tokens. But they don't present an immediateediate threat because they don't currently offer the same cryThey are very popular and will most likely catch up eventually crypto fund lineup. investment technology to manage c ENTIRE PORTFOLIOS Betterments has at the portfolio In time they may, but right now they are a bit behind. <br>
[Wealthfront's crypto productline](https://support.wealthfront.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403721436948-Cryptocurrency-at-Wealthfront) has two crypto ETF "funds" but it has more of an inidrect approach rather than a direct channel to purchase crypto coins in real time, at spot prices. This is because they mostly invest in crypto with Futures Contracts and International Securities Markets and instead of investing the capital directly into crypto coins and tokens. They buy stock in Pubic Comapnies who have made significant investments into crypto. That's kinda like buying Coinbase stock and calling it Bitcoin, they aren't synonymous. 
* **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?** (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– use sites like StackShare to find this information.) <br>
The company tech stack is comprised of 46 technology products and services built on a foundation of HTML5, jQuery and Google Analytics. This year alone, the projected IT spend is estimated to be $618.9k according to [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/betterment/technology)! cites the *applications and data* holding the most software progams in the techstack in the tech stack at **15**. Some examples include: JavaScript, Python and Google Cloud. More detailed information is available on [StackShare](https://stackshare.io/betterment/betterment).
## Landscape
* **What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**  <br>
    Robo-advising: Both "Pure" Robo and Hybrid Models. [Robo and Hybrid Diagram] (https://screenrec.com/share/BekQ5H1SPs)<br>
* **What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?** <br>
    The (GFC) literally broke our old financial system. Since that time, Incumbent "Big Banks" have been trying to modernize their IT infrastructure at lightspeed in order to keep up with the startups. Ironically, this same timeframe is when Betterment was founded. The (GFC) accelerated the advent of asset digitization and Robo-Advisory Digital Investment Management. Since that time, adjacent technologies have emerged (IoT, Cloud, Blochchain, AI and Machine Learning) fueling exponential growth into this space. **COVID-19** also accelerated the flight to digital assets. has also been a major catlyst for the digitization of the financial system, which lowered the barrier-to-entry for the every-day consumer. [The World Bank](worldbank.org/en/publication/fintech-and-the-future-of-finance) describes this digital asset revolution as a "paradigm shift" in the financial service industry. Mergers and Acquisitions are about to get interesting. For example, [Empower Retirement acquired Personal Capital in 2020 for $1 Billion](https://www.empower.com/press-center-empower-retirement-completes-personal-capital-acquisition#:~:text=GREENWOOD%20VILLAGE%2C%20Colorado%2C%20August%2018-announced%20on%20June%2029%2C%202020). <br>In more recent news, UBS offered Wealthfront a $1.4 billion buyout in 2022, only to have the deal unravel later that year [https://www.barrons.com/advisor/articlesubs-wealthfront-acquisition-cancelled-51662573928]. This recent M&A activity poses an intriguing proposition for Betterment: What is the best path forward? Proceed with the status quo, soaking up market share along the way OR consider a merge with a bigger player at an attractive valuation? 
* **What are the other major companies in this domain?** <br>
    The RA industry is rapidly expanding and technology changes sometimes by the minute. This can make it can be challenging to determine the key players. 
    Many large firms have entered the fray - bringing their own proprietary investment algorithms to market. A few notables include: Morgan Stanley Access Investing, FidelityGo, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios and Merrill Edge Guided Investing. These Bohemoths have a large user base and resources galore, but they lack FINTECH architecture (a major headwind). Antiquated platforms can lead to an inferior client experience. Conversely, RA startups tout modernized IT platforms, sleek UIs and a superior client experience. However, they either lack the resources needed to create the same economies of scale or haven't experienced the same level of succes. <br>
    In either case, Big Bank or Startup, it became evident category as the aforementioned Top 5. To use a baseball analogy, they are good AAA baseball players with Major League potential. Maybe only a few homeruns away from playing in the big leagues? However the upper eschelon of the RA industry consists of SoFi, Etrade Core and Vanguard Digital Adviser are similar to Betterment and deserve high praise, but Wealthfront is the closest match. <br>
## Results <br>
* **What has been the business impact of this company so far?** [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-robo-advisors/) published the article with much of the same criteria as other studies. Again Betterment was voted best RA in class, with Wealthfront coming in second. In fairness, Wealthfront has also received significant notoriety. [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/wealthfront-vs-betterment-4587963#citation-5) is a big advocate of [Nerd Wallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/betterment-vs-wealthfront) failed to declare a winner between the two, but gave the edge to Betterment in terms of human financial advice. Since being one of the first RA's to hit the market in 2008, Betterment has evolved from a grass roots movement to arguably THE top RA firm in the business. Company growth and influence have proven a major disrupter to the investment management industry. [Investingtheweb.com] postef that as of December 2022, Vanguard is the clear AUM leader with $140B, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios is next at $70B, Wealthfront with $34 Billion and Betterment at $32 Billion  Of the $4 Trillion RA market cap, Betterment has acquired roughly 8% AUM market share. Wealthfront slightly higher at 8.5%
* **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**
There's an extensive list of business metrics used to evaulate financial health of an RA. Total Assets Under Management (AUM) is perhaps the most common, but can be somewhat misleading - especially when comparing two nearly identical companies in the same market cap range (Betterment/Wealthfront). Crunchbase lists other key RA metrics like: Mobile App Downloads, Web Traffic, Visit Duration and Bounce Rates. These indicators reveal much more than just a basic AUM calculation.
* **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**
Mobile App & Web Traffic Comparison
Betterment: Mobile App Downloads (Last 30 days): 24,960, Monthly Download Growth: 14.45%, Monthly Web Visits: 4,780,822, Monthly Visits Growth: 45.09%
Wealthfront: Mobile App Downloads (Last 30 days): 21,412, Monthly Download Growth: 14.25%, Monthly Web Visits: 1,723,746, Monthly Visits Growth: 24.32%
Key Takeaways: At first glance it appears that Betterment is demolishing Wealthfromnt. And truthfully, they are in this particular metric category. Betterment had nearly 3 million more website visits and a growth rate 20% higher than Wealthfront. Meanwhile, the Engagement numbers tell a different story. 
Engagement Comparison
Betterment: Visit Duration: 719 seconds, Visit Duration Growth: -14.71%, Bounce Rate: 43.1%, Bounce Rate Growth 11.28%
Wealthfront: Visit Duration: 607 seconds, Visit Duration Growth: 19.25%, Bounce Rate: 44.26%, Bounce Rate Growth -3.38%
Key Takeaways: [Visit Duration](https://support.similarweb.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000501485-Average-Visit-Duration#:~:text=Calculation%20of%20visit%20duration_a%20website%20during%20a%20visit)is the total amount of time a user spends on the website, from landing page to exit. RAs generally want this number to be as high as possible, because it means the average user is spending more time on their website. [Bounce rate](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-bounce-rate-fix#:~:text=The%20average%20bounce%20rate%20isto%20double%2Dcheck%20some%20things) tracks the 'one-click wonders' who only view one page before exiting. This could mean the landing page was confusing or it didn't capture their attention. Bounce rates appear to be close but an 11% increase is a concern, especially when Wealthfront has reduced their bounce rate over the same timeframe.
## Recommendation
* **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?** (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
1. Consider simpfliying the model portfolio suite. Smart Beta was all the rave 5-6 years ago, but isn't in high demand anymore. BlackRock Target Income is 100% bonds and not very "sexy". I can appreciate the crypto portfolio options, but four may overwhelming for the average consumer. Many are still trying to understand what crypto is, let alone stress over the right portfolio. 
2. Reevaluate Direct Indexing Technology. ESG investments are becoming much more mainstream, as is portfolio customization. Direct indexing is currently offered by Wealthfront, Vanguard and Schwab. Betterment doesn't offer direct indexing but does have fractional shares. Wealthfront is just the opposite. It appears that they have tried to bridge the gap by offering 3 SRI Model Portfolios?
3. Explore a Hedge Fund Quantitative Investing Product. This technology has the disruption potential. Quants utilize a more advanced AI than algorithmic RA models and provide faster trade execution. They also leverage double back-testing and strategic modulation functionality which can be very powerful. I imagine they have also considered this in the past. I wasn't able to get to ChatGBT, but's a threat with the potential to dominate every market.
* **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?** 
Simplifying the portfolio suite could drive more widespread adoption and increase revenue. Direct Indexing is a hot topic right now. Many of the key players in this space already already have it and the fact that Betterment still doesn't - is a vulnerabity oftern mentioned in client surveys. It may be time to consider adding this functionality. The cost of Quant technology isn't cheap and the risk is high. However, so could be the reward for the first RA firm that brings the product to market. One thing is for certain, it's going to be an exciting journey!
